# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates GitHub authentication with a blockchain-based bounty system using Avalanche subnets. The system enables developers to create trustless bounties for pull requests, build on-chain reputation, and manage escrow payments without transaction costs. The integration includes GitHub OAuth login, smart contract deployment on Avalanche L1, and a seamless user experience connecting traditional development workflows with blockchain incentives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GitHub Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate using my GitHub account, so that I can access the platform and link my development activity to my identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Start Building" button THEN the system SHALL redirect to GitHub OAuth authentication
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with GitHub THEN the system SHALL store their GitHub profile information and session
3. WHEN an authenticated user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL display their GitHub username and avatar
4. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL show the GitHub login button instead of authenticated content
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to the home page

### Requirement 2: Blockchain Contract Integration

**User Story:** As a bounty creator, I want to create trustless bounties on the blockchain, so that payments are automatically escrowed and released when work is completed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a bounty THEN the system SHALL deploy the bounty to the Avalanche L1 subnet with zero transaction costs
2. WHEN funds are deposited for a bounty THEN the smart contract SHALL hold them in escrow until completion
3. WHEN a developer proposes completion THEN the system SHALL record the proposal on-chain
4. WHEN a bounty creator approves completion THEN the smart contract SHALL automatically release funds to the developer
5. IF a bounty expires or is cancelled THEN the smart contract SHALL return funds to the creator after the timelock period

### Requirement 3: Pull Request On-Chain Submission

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to submit pull requests on-chain, so that my contributions are permanently recorded and contribute to my reputation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer submits a pull request for a bounty THEN the system SHALL record the submission hash on the blockchain
2. WHEN a pull request is merged THEN the system SHALL update the on-chain record with completion status
3. WHEN multiple developers submit for the same bounty THEN the system SHALL maintain a chronological record of all submissions
4. IF a pull request is rejected THEN the system SHALL update the on-chain status accordingly
5. WHEN viewing a bounty THEN users SHALL see all on-chain pull request submissions with their current status

### Requirement 4: Developer Reputation System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build my reputation on-chain through completed bounties, so that I can demonstrate my skills and earn trust in the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer completes a bounty THEN the system SHALL increase their on-chain reputation score
2. WHEN calculating reputation THEN the system SHALL consider bounty value, completion time, and quality metrics
3. WHEN viewing a developer's profile THEN users SHALL see their total reputation, completed bounties, and earnings
4. IF a developer has a high reputation THEN the system SHALL highlight them as a trusted contributor
5. WHEN reputation is updated THEN the changes SHALL be permanently recorded on the blockchain

### Requirement 5: Smart Contract Error Handling and Security

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the smart contracts to be secure and handle errors gracefully, so that my funds and data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any contract function is called THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs and revert on invalid data
2. WHEN transferring funds THEN the contract SHALL use reentrancy guards and follow CEI pattern
3. WHEN a contract error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
4. IF the contract state becomes inconsistent THEN the system SHALL have recovery mechanisms
5. WHEN deploying contracts THEN the system SHALL verify all contract code is free of common vulnerabilities

### Requirement 6: Frontend Integration and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a seamless experience between the web interface and blockchain functionality, so that I can easily create and manage bounties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL connect to the user's wallet and display connection status
2. WHEN creating a bounty THEN the interface SHALL show real-time transaction status and confirmations
3. WHEN viewing bounties THEN the system SHALL display current blockchain state and pending transactions
4. IF a blockchain transaction fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages and suggested actions
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL validate all blockchain connections and contract deployments

### Requirement 7: Development and Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer working on this system, I want proper testing and development tools, so that I can ensure the system works correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the development server THEN the system SHALL connect to a local or testnet blockchain
2. WHEN testing contract functionality THEN the system SHALL provide mock data and test scenarios
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL validate all TypeScript types and contract interfaces
4. IF there are build errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with file locations
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL verify all environment variables and configurations are correct
